# Galaxy Creator

## Project Overview:

This Galaxy Creator tool allows users to create a fantasy galaxy of their choosing (viewed from Earth). There are two modes: sky over a snowy hill, or sky over ocean. The user’s main tools are tracker or mouse clicks to ‘draw’ objects in the sky, as well as the ability to press different keys on the keyboard to draw different objects. The end goal for the users is to create any kind of ‘galaxy’ they would like to create. For example, they could create a galaxy with many colorful planets visible from Earth that would be impossible to see in real life. Or, they could create a new constellation with stars. They could even pretend to be in Star Wars and add multiple moons to their night sky view. I think that using my canvas is exciting and engaging because of the limitless possibilities for different combinations of stars, moons, and planets. I like that my canvas is very colorful and eye catching, and no matter what the user decides to draw, their end product will be beautiful and interesting in its own way. I also wanted to maximize the ease of creation through my ‘click to draw’ feature. I often feel that drawing actual lines with a mouse or tracker can be difficult and frustrating, so having pre-drawn objects that can be deployed with a click makes the entire creative process much more accessible. Anyone, from kids to adults, could enjoy using this creator. Users could create their own art, or even use the canvas as a medium for studying astronomy and constellations by drawing star patterns from memory.


This system is personally meaningful to me because I have always loved stargazing. When I was younger, I had an augmented reality app called SkyGuide that would show information about stars, galaxies, planets, and other heavenly bodies if you held your phone camera up to the sky. I absolutely loved using this app and learning the names of all the objects I could see in the sky. Recently, there was a meteor shower late at night that I watched outside of my dorm. It was amazing to see so many meteors shooting by. I hope to translate the wonder of stargazing into my creator for this project, and add the element of imagination so that users can be inspired by what they’ve seen in the sky and take it to the next level to create art.


This project challenged me as a computer scientist, firstly because I had to learn the new language of Processing. Similar to other visual computational creativity projects, the mental shift to coding for an artistic purpose requires some adjustment. I used the Processing documentation extensively to get inspiration for my project and implement my vision. I did a lot of trial and error in creating my shapes. For example, I decided to use two triangles superimposed on top of each other to create my star shape. I also had to figure out the best way to implement the ‘click to draw’ feature. In the initial stages of development, I was able to make objects appear on screen when I clicked, but couldn’t make them stay, so I had to figure out the correct way to use the mouseClicked() function for that purpose. I also enjoyed the process of incorporating the ‘Noise Wave’ example code into my creator, and altering its original features for my own purposes. Going forward, I’d love to expand this project into a 3D space. It would be exciting to be able to drag your mouse around and see your creation in a 3D rendered area, so that the user could see new dimensions of their galaxy and the bodies in it. 

## How to Use:

1. Download GalaxyCreator code and open it in the Processing IDE.
2. Press run to see a Java window pop up (the canvas)
3. Choose your background: Snowy Hill or Blue Ocean
4. To get Snowy Hill, press and drag your tracker (trackpad). ❄️
5. To get Blue Ocean, press the LEFT arrow on your keyboard and then press and drag the tracker.
6. Then, add elements by clicking to draw!
7. To add a moon: press UP arrow and then click on the part of the canvas where you want your moon to go.
8. Stars: press DOWN arrow and then click on the canvas.
9. Orange Planet: press RIGHT arrow, then click.
10. Purple Planet: press SHIFT, then click.
11. Blue Orb: press CONTROL, then click.
12. Death Star: press DELETE, then click.

13. To document your work, take a screenshot!
14. To start with a fresh canvas, press and drag the tracker along the wave formation, erasing all of your objects.
15. Be careful not to press and drag the tracker while you're creating, as this action will erase your work.
16. Before adding objects, feel free to play with pressing and dragging to create different wave shapes.

Lots of credit due to the Processing documentation that helped me figure out syntax for creating various shapes and incorporating the use of key codes.

Professor Harmon’s Bubbles example, which inspired me to use tracker clicks as an integral tool for the user’s creative experience.

Daniel Shiffman’s ‘Noise Wave’ example, from which I borrowed code for the wave background in my project. Also inspired me to build off of the wave idea and include a mode for ‘snowy hill’ using the same ‘wave’ shape.
